# About Project
In this course, I fabricated a miniature replica cannon out of aluminum and acrylic stock pieces. This was done using a combination of manual and CNC processes, including programming tool paths.

To create the aluminum sides and bottom plate, I used manual lathes and mills. I turned a stock aluminum rod (located inside of the cannon barrel) on a lathe to get the correct diameter and created a hole on the end to thread and insert a screw. I used a mill to cut and smooth the edges of the aluminum plate, as well as programmed a manual tool path to create holes in the correct locations on one of the side pieces. I referenced technical drawings throughout and used calipers and rulers to check dimensions manually, both before and after fabrication.

To create the aluminum front and acrylic back, I used CNC lathes and mills. I programmed tool paths using Fusion 360 to perform similar operations as the manual side, such as contouring edges using end and face mills, and turning the aluminum front to get a cone shape using a lathe.
